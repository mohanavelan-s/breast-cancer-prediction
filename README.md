**Breast Cancer Prediction**

This project is a simple machine learning model built to predict breast cancer using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The dataset used is the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset available in scikit-learn.

I created this project to practice my ML skills and get hands-on experience with building and testing models.


**🔍 Project Overview**

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (built into scikit-learn)

Goal: Predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign

**⚙️ How It Works**

Import the dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate the accuracy on test data.

**📊 Results**

Achieved ~95% accuracy on the test dataset (results may vary slightly).
**
🚀 Why This Project?**

I wanted to practice:

Handling datasets in scikit-learn

Building a classification model

Evaluating performance

**📌 Future Improvements**

Try other ML models like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks

Add data visualization for better insights

Deploy the model as a simple web app
